# Absenteeism Project

Description of project and files:

Absenteeism Data - This dataset looks to address the business problem of abseenteeism at a company during work time/
The set employee information and will be used to predict whether they are likely to be absent from work given a number of factors.
Columns contain information like Age, Distance to Work, and Reason for Absence.
This project explores supervised logistic regression to predict the chance of 'excessive absenteeism' for employees

1) 'Abseenteeism Preprocess.ipynb' - Exploring the data and steps to preprocess, including cleaning, creating dummy variables and removing irrelevant data

2) 'Absenteeism Logistic Regression.ipynb' - Create targets, create custom scaler functions, determine what are the most significant factors affecting absenteeism and finally predicting the probability of excessive absenteeism.

3) 'absenteeism_module.py' - A module containing consolidated code from the preprocessing and log regression to allow new data to be easily analysed.

4) 'Absenteeism Exercise - Integration.ipynb' - Walkthrough of using module and new employee data to test it works


i) 'Absenteeism-data.csv'- Original data used from the start of the project
ii) 'Absenteeism_preprocessed.csv' - A cleaned version of the data used to start the log regression
iii) 'Absenteeism_new_data.csv' - Data to be used in the module as proof new data works
